Regions

* Sectional regions will have at least 12 citizens.

Leadership

Central Advisory Council
* A central advisory council will advise and administer the union. 
* The central advisory council pools 3 representatives with diverse experiences from each cardinal region.
* Further sectionality is possible within each region, but only 3 representatives from each region serve in the council.

Chief
* A chief represents the Central Advisory Council to serve the union.

This model is fractal and will reverberate throughout each regional leadership structure.

* Randomly select 2 willing individuals from 3 socioeconomic categories - high, mid, and low.
* Randomly select 2 willing individuals from 3 ethnically populous categories - high, mid, and low.
* Regions will evaluate selections with extreme scenarios to represent the candidate's embodiment of these Biblical virtues:  Love, Faith, Hope, Humility, Integrity, Wisdom, Righteousness, Self-control, Patience, Diligence, Courage, Perseverance, Joy, Peace, Kindness, Compassion, Forgiveness, Generosity, Service, Trustworthiness, Gentleness, Obedience, Fidelity, Zeal, Meekness, Long-suffering, Hospitality, Gratitude, Contentment, Sincerity, Modesty, Discipline, Justice, Faithfulness, Purity.
